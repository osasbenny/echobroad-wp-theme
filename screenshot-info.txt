Screenshot Requirements for WordPress Theme
==========================================

The theme requires a screenshot.png file (1200x900px) showing the theme design.

To add a screenshot:
1. Take a screenshot of the homepage
2. Resize to 1200x900 pixels
3. Save as screenshot.png in the theme root directory

This will display in the WordPress theme selector.
